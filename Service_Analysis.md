## History
The name Berger or *Lewis Berger* is today synonymous with colour worldwide. But actually the origin of the name dates back to over two & a half centuries in England in **1760**, when a young colour chemist named Lewis Berger, started manufacturing in Europe, 'Prussian blue' using a secret process that every designer and householder coveted. Mr. Berger perfected this process & art of the blue colour, which was the colour of most military uniforms of that time. Enriched by the imagination of Lewis Berger, the unending quest for creation and innovation in the world of colour & paints still continues.

The team which was assighned for our house was completely unprofessional and didn't took measures that were told by the sales manager of Berger.
