## History
The name Berger or *Lewis Berger* is today synonymous with colour worldwide. But actually the origin of the name dates back to over two & a half centuries in England in **1760**, when a young colour chemist named Lewis Berger, started manufacturing in Europe, 'Prussian blue' using a secret process that every designer and householder coveted. Mr. Berger perfected this process & art of the blue colour, which was the colour of most military uniforms of that time. Enriched by the imagination of Lewis Berger, the unending quest for creation and innovation in the world of colour & paints still continues.

|Best liked readme.md on github |https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template#readme|
|My readme.md on github |https://github.com/Aayon-Mukherjee/Passion/blob/c3e77cf8d6491aa2412bea7388a58cd152aec097/Passion.md
|Status of Self created |Not Satisfactory|
|Description of Self Analysis | Being my first repo on github, I didn't had any idea or experience in the field. I tried my level best for providing a nice story about my passion but after the guidance of my sir Mr. Varad Gupta, I came to realize that using of spaces and indentation plays a vital role in a project, so that a user can enjoy reading the story and also it makes it look more professional. The mistakes in my previous project will not be repeated again as I came to know all the flaws about it like capitalization of initial letters, using **bold** and *italic* fonts wherever required, providing proper spaces after every line and making the text more readable.

## **Improvements to be made on Passion.md:**

* Using of Proper Spaces and intents.
* Using of more fonts like **bold** and *italic*.
* Providing proper spaces after every line.
* Making it more readable for the user.
